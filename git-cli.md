# VIM Editor Commands
i - Insert

    Press Esc key: This is very important because you must exit the edit mode first before typing the exit command(s). Next, you can type one of the following commands:
    :q (yes, the colon is included in the command) – This will quit the editor
    :q! – Quit Vim without saving the data file
    :wq – Save the file and exit Vim
    And then Enter key
